# The Story Behind Our Website

As high school students, we are concerned by our future, especially our CEGEP choices. Which school has our dream programï¼Ÿ We believe we are not the only ones, at our age, who keep asking ourselves this question.

The website we created compares CEGEPs according to their programs. This is an easier way to compare the different requirements and courses offered for a program while staying on the same website.

During this 24-hour hackathon, we have surpassed ourselves by learning and applying new knowledge to create and improve our project. Our greatest achievement is to have finished a demo-able and fairly complete product.
